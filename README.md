# froggv2
Frog-shaped keychain, with two LEDs that turn on when a button is pushed and dim out when the button is let go of, thanks to a capacitor in parallel with the LEDs.

This was my first time creating a PCB or even working with electronics so it was great fun and an awesome learning opportunity. :D

Mr frogg is as frog as frogs get, how could you not love him?
